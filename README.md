# The Baumgartnerizer

https://adorsk.github.io/baumgartnerizer/

The Baumgartnerizer is an image transformer that produces images in the style of [Christiane Baumgartner's](https://www.christiane-baumgartner.com/) monochrome woodcuts.

The inspiration for this transformer was Baumgartner's ["The Wave"](https://www.christiane-baumgartner.com/work/editions/the_wave.gif). I had the good fortune to see this piece at the Boston MFA's ["Hokusai: Inspiration and Infleunce" Exhibit](https://www.mfa.org/exhibition/hokusai-inspiration-and-influence) in 2023. It left an impression on me.

I hope that you enjoy playing with the Baumgartnerizer. Maybe you'll make something that will leave an impression on someone else.
